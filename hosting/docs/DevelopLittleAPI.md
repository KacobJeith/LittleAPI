Working with APIs can be a headache. Integrations, usability, data structure, richness of querying, and data volume are all highly variable, and can sometimes get in the way of building your product, service, or simple project. In the worst cases, API responses can actually crash your computer or device by causing memory overflows. This is why we decided to build LittleAPI - to enable easier access to rich and variable data.
